# üèóÔ∏è SQL Data Warehouse Project ‚Äì CRM & ERP Integration via Medallion Architecture

## üìò Overview

This project demonstrates a full-stack SQL-based data warehouse pipeline that ingests raw CSV files from CRM and ERP systems, transforms them through a medallion architecture (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold), and exposes clean, queryable views for analytics and reporting.

Built for municipal and enterprise contexts, the solution emphasizes modularity, traceability, and performance‚Äîideal for strategic controllers, BI architects, and data engineers.

## üß± Architecture

The pipeline follows the **Medallion Strategy**:

| Layer   | Purpose                                  | Format         |
|---------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Bronze  | Raw ingestion from CRM/ERP CSV files     | Staged tables  |
| Silver  | Cleaned, conformed, and enriched data    | SQL procedures |
| Gold    | Business-ready dimensional models & facts| SQL views      |

Schemas are created as part of the initialization:


üìÇ Source Systems
CRM: Customer info, product catalog, sales details

ERP: Customer demographics, location data, product categories

CSV files are staged in the datasets/ folder and loaded via SQL scripts and stored procedures.

Gold Layer
Final views are created for:

gold.dim_customers

gold.dim_products

gold.fact_sales

These views support BI dashboards and KPI tracking

üìå Tools & Tech
SQL Server

QuickDBD (ERD modeling)

GitHub for version control

Notion for documentation template
